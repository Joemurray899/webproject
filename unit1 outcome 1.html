        what do you need to make projects successful?

        <br>

        <p>first of all, you need to be a problem solver when it comes to skills you have to be able to pay attention to all the details and not miss a thing 
            it's apart of the daily schedule for digital project designers to be handed a task and find the resources in order to solve said task's 
            HTML/CSS" is also very important they are the 2 base languages in order to even structuring the design of web pages inside and out or even to add an extra flair to websites with colors layouts and fonts these 2 are the bare bones of even starting to make the website and also relationship building with your co-workers so you can provide help and receive help efficiently and secure it makes one reliable and also easier to place faith in others for help without anxiety or communication walls

                <h1>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board.</h1>
                <br>
                <br>
                first of all, i needed to get ''Grammarly'' Extention to my chrome browser this alone will help with making my written work a lot more presentable this is pretty much the way of things for Trello now I'm focusing on my written work once done I will move that to the done section and start importing my written work to my code/web project the Trello just helps me plan ahead and it lets me check at the end if I've done everything right and if there is anything more to do
here is the link to my Trello board

<h1>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p1>one of the most basic examples is time money and attention sometimes a project and fail due to not enough resources or even manpower due to these factors many a business can lose out on opportunities be it early or late in the project to combat this you need to ensure that all projects have enough resources and more just so maybe so you don't even run out of resources at all which is ideal you'd want to have full choice and chance on what you can use always! sometimes even strategy alone can be the downfall maybe you just planned poorly or did not expect certain things to hit so hard like the cost of data space for example even the manager's of the project what have they done wrong maybe they failed to get a crucial meeting and or brief session
    or maybe they lost a very important contact! even simple things like budget and or funding can make the whole project crash into an early finish
    so again your best option is to plan you don't wanna enter a project together with half the time half the money half the workers you need to carefully assess every factor that goes into making this a success and ensure the requirements is met 100%!</p>

    <h1>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Well firstly id say id take to the internet id write my problems into questions for google search and I'm bound to get endless results and pointers and for when it comes to picking software and it systems id start with the basics like (Office, Excel, Word, PowerPoint, Outlook)  id also secure me and my team had secure browsers like firefox and chrome to ensure our safety online we would need stuff for communication too like slack skype Trello to provide some real-time communication and examples for the project I find even with these basic preparations we can work as a team and further discuss plans and how to stretch out to better tech and software to further our development of the project and or better our teamwork</p>

    <h1>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        Trello was very key when it came to teamwork planning and assigning responsibilities as for GitHub and git it can provide so much firstly it makes it easy for you to keep track of your new and old finished and current personal projects and even team-based/collaborative projects but more importantly, GitHub can also allow other people to input their own fixes into your personal/collaborative projects this can be things such as graphs and or code</p>
