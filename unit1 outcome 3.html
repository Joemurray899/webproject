<br><h1>Unit 1, Outcome 3</h1><hr><br>
<hr>
<br>
<br>
<h1>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p>when working with a team we could have assigned certain roles like  research into CSS inputs/javascript/pygame/written work we all could've worked on this project together and not fail to manage time properly planning would be better more people would be giving ideas for the Trello together as a team we could've made this project bigger better more fun and got it done a lot faster</p>
<hr>
<br>
<br>
<h1>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency
</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p>I could have worked a lot more efficiently with a team that for sure but also if i had done my Trello board at the beginning I know i would've had a better grasp on my final project as for productivity again its down to poor time management with taking to long to research i should have also done like 2 hours a night extra just for better approaches and research</p>

<h1>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p>firstly yes teamwork and slack usage is perfect for communication planning and execution next time I would like to have a full team a couple of slack channels and a Trello board done on day one and updated daily and research done before the project start's so I don't have to waste time maybe even set up the general management of the project needs to be better on the inside and the outside you need to plan the code and concept well and you also need to display it publicly well-allowing people understand how it was made beginning to end

<h1>
    3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>before my next project can start I need to master CSS java HTML python with these different languages in my possession I will have a lot better understanding of how to implement the things I want to be able to fix what breaks and stop things from having syntax errors in the first place I also need to use things like flex box in my personal time / personal projects this alone will be the perfect testing ground for my coding skills this will allow me to open and expand my knowledge and experience so I don't ever get stuck again
