    <h1>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello
    </h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>when it comes to visual studio code and Trello I'm very happy because they did let me practice they did let me plan ahead and scope out my project in any way I needed just so I could visualize it and simplify it at first I had no idea of the approach but with enough time my tools and approach was good I just wish I had more time to import CSS before deadline day it definitely would've added a lot more animations for the buttons and moving images and or clips same for colors and better layouts next time I need to look more into flexbox too

        2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello </h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>I was very happy with both visual studio code and Trello with visual studio its very user friendly especially for me a beginner its always auto-suggesting you what your inputs are going to be  and it works very fast and accurate a lot of the time this leads to it helping you remember what you want to type or even to do it faster you can even add extensions / add ons to it to help you further and or help make visual studio run and work more suited for your needs as for Trello it's simple and clean it's structured out so well it allows you to start from step 1 all the way to end project the simple layout really helps with just taking it to step by step planning well and not missing a thing

        <h1>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>yes i am happy with my website but I do wish i had the time to make it look a lot more professional when it comes to strengths i planned well i researched well and i got my website working i started this thinking i could not do it so I'm happy for that as for weaknesses yes i did good research but i spent way to long doing it next time i will have more base knowledge about this process so i wont get stuck i can just continue to do get my work done </p>

        <h1>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>I need to learn more CSS for the website so I can make it look a lot more professional and easy on the eyes instead of just displaying a HTML skeleton with lots of <br> commands i need to research more things in my personal time like flexbox I don't know any java script yet I imagine that would've been a nice addition to my site so ill have to get that done in my personal time just for training I wanted more images I wanted my links to be buttons and light up or play a fun animation maybe even a small window for a fun little interactive .py game </p>
