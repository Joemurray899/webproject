    </h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>so basically i start with a basic html skeleton first i set my title> as "Joseph Murray" naming my page after me just for a more professional look then i started with my about me section on the home page adding an royalty free image on the page too with the img src= command after that i added my h for my "about me text title" and then i add p to write out my about me section once i found my html skeleton was up and running i wanted to add some spacing with the brcommand to finish of my home page i crated html for all my pages (unit 1 - unit 2) then i cerated hyperlink commands to every page so you can just click to any page you want from any page your on (including a home page hyperlink) after this i started to input my written work into my website first i set my title as Unit 1, Outcome 1 i start wit a header displaying each question h and then a paragraph to display my answers p i added 2 br between each text but with my written work i also started to implement a hr command which just added an underline in between unit questions and awnsers</p>

    <h>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites </h>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>when it comes to copyright when you buy some professional big name big brand software this law basically just stops you from selling your own copies of the software when it comes to other intellectual property laws affect websites because it may restrict what you are able to publish.  The best way to get around this is first, get permission from the original author, second, if you want to publish information on your site from another site, link to it and perhaps get permission to publish an excerpt from the original site this is why people tend to go for royalty free software and images / videos because its alot less preassure on the project and its contents and or team</p>

    <h1>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them
    </h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>first of all, you want to avoid any hate speech on the disabled no ill talking no shaming no any bad stuff its just wrong in the first place but anyway some people may be blind will need to rely on screen readers (software that reads text on the screen with a synthetic voice) and/or refreshable braille displays (a device that dynamically displays lines of text on the screen in braille) some people might have color blindness and will need things like the color that is used as a unique marker to emphasize text on a Web site
        or even text that inadequately contrasts with background color or patterns deaf people will need captions we need to always think about this when developing a digital project/website

        <h1>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>well firstly when it comes to website folders your going to want to import your images as .jpeg .png .svg .gif your going to need these in the first place so your software can even understand what it is your importing  even for audio you'll be needing .mp3 or .wav files so your code or software can understand the music / play it you can have zipped files that just compress entire archives and also extract them directory to the said software
